BASIC TYPES:


there are several core types: number, string, boolean, function, object

null, undefined are actually both types, although just particular instances 
   of objects, and arrays a special case of objects.

if we have a variable in javascript, type is: typeof x
  note arrays will return 'object'.  see section on arrays.

NUMBERS
- 64bit double precision floating point numbers -- there are no "integer" types in javascript.
- that means you have 53 bits of precision.
- if you are going to represent 64bits in javascript, use strings or separate library
- if you're doing math ops on floating point numbers, be careful
  - 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3
- integer numbers < 53 bits will be great because they can be exactly rep'd
- dividing by zero gives you (-)Infinity
- you can convert strings to numbers with parseInt or parseFloat
  - if they fail, return NaN
  - isNaN
- can test for a "valid" number with isFinite()



BOOLEANS:
- can have the value true or false
- you can force things to boolean with the Booelan(XXX) function, but rarely necessary
- "=="is same value"  "===" same value AND type


STRINGS:
- strings are sequences of unicode characters
- great for most characters around the world
- no separate character data type -- can just use 1-char strings
- to get the length, jut use .length
var s = "my string";
console.log(s.length);    - prints the length of the string to the console 
// or
console.log("my string".length);

many interesting functions on strings:

int str.indexOf("there");   - returns the index of "there" in string or -1
string "hello there".slice(5, 6) == " " // true    
    origin 0 - returns the character starting at 5, ending before 6
string "hello there".substr(5, 1) == " " // true
   origin 0 - returns the character starting at 5, length 1
array "1,2,3,4,5".split(",")   - parses on "," and returns an array

null is a special value   indicates non-value
undefined means no such thing or no value set yet

var x;
-> undefined
console.log(x);
-> undefined

Strings can build using "+"
"cats + " go " + "meow"  = results in "cats go meow"
.trim() - removes leadning and trailing white space
Regular expressions are also supported 
  "aaoo".replace(/[Aa]{2,}/, "b");    // replace A or a with b
  "aaoo".search(/[Aa]{2,}/);          // returns 0
  "aoo".search(/[Aa]{2,}/);           // returns -1 (not found)
